## [Indian Air Quality Analysis](https://github.com/Abhishek-Aditya-bs/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Indian-Air-Quality-Analysis)

Air is what keeps humans alive. Monitoring it and understanding its quality is of immense importance to our well-being. In this project, analysis is performed on different pollutants in the air in some of well known cities in India.

The dataset that we will be using is [Air Quality Data in India (2015 - 2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india) taken from Kaggle.

The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India.

The various cities in the dataset includes Ahmedabad, Aizawl, Amaravati, Amritsar, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Brajrajnagar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi, Ernakulam, Gurugram, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jorapokhar, Kochi, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Patna, Shillong, Talcher, Thiruvananthapuram, Visakhapatnam

The data has been made publicly available by the [Central Pollution Control Board](https://cpcb.nic.in/) which is the official portal of Government of India.

Through the analysis performed we see that

1. Pollution in Bangalore is greater than pollution in Delhi
2. Pollution in Coastal cities is greater than pollution in non coastal cities.
3. Pollution in cities which are connected by the golden quadrilateral is lesser than pollution in cities outside the golden quadrilateral

## [Indian Water Quality Analysis](https://github.com/Abhishek-Aditya-bs/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Indian-Water-Quality-Analysis)

Through this project we wanted to analyse the Quality of different rivers and lakes in India, thereby predicting different levels of pollution in different water bodies in different states. For this we have selected a corresponding dataset and we have performed data analysis. Firstly, we have cleaned the dataset with appropriate methods and then we have performed certain visual and graph representation to infer important results, followed by normalisation of the cleaned data. Then we have used hypothesis testing on one of the population parameters to draw pre-conclusions on certain aspects, followed by heat map representing the correlation between two population parameters. In the end, we have used linear regression to show the dependence of two population parameters, followed by results and conclusion. 

Through the analysis performed we see that 

1. Punjab has the highest Total coliform level and second highest B.O.D levels thereby showing that it has the most polluted water in India, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh having the least polluted water bodies.
2. Daman & Diu has the highest B.O.D (mg/l) level so we can say that Daman & Diu water bodies has very less oxygen saturation in water due to the presence of algae pathogens, toxic substances, proving harmful for the aquatic life.
3. Tamil Nadu has most water bodies with pH level 6.5 followed by GOA which has most water bodies with pH level 6.75 means water is acidic and is unfit for use and harmful for the environment as well.
